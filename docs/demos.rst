Demos
=====

These demos illustrate how DTCC Platform can be used. New users should start with the first demo and work through them in sequence. The demos are self-contained Python programs that can be run as follows::

    $ python name_of_demo.py

`Complete Python code for all demos <https://github.com/dtcc-platform/dtcc/tree/develop/demos>`_ can found in the ``demos`` directory in the ``dtcc`` Python package.
